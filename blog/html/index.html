            <h1><a href="2016/07/01/code_reviews_instead_of_whiteboard_for_interviews.html">Code reviews instead of whiteboard for interviews</a></h1>
<p>Of late I’ve been thinking a lot about interviews. After being part of this
community (or industry if you fancy it) for more than 15 years, I’ve had my
share of sitting on both sides of the table. A lot has changed in all these
years with the tools we work with as well as the way we approach problems.</p>
<p>However, in all these years not a whole lot has changed in the way we interview
(or approach interviewing). Sure, we have better tools and have questioned
ourselves about the methodology but at some point we all end up defaulting to
focusing on the candidates ability to write good code. This ability though is
just a small part of how we work on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The other day I was reviewing a colleague’s patchset and although the code by
itself was clean and functional, it was the approach that my colleague had
taken which bothered me a bit. So I made my comments and submitted a -1 on the
patchset. As is customary when it is easier to just speak about it than reply
thru’ the tool (we use gerrit), my colleague walked over to my desk and we
spent a good half hour or so discussing the approach. That’s when I got to
wondering why don’t we just do more of this during interviews.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We can quickly weed out people who can’t write code just by testing their
ability to comprehend code. If they can’t recognize well known datastuctures
or algorithms by looking at the code, they probably won’t be able to write it
either.</li>
<li>Hearing someone review some piece of code gives invaluable insight into just
how they think. The colleague I mentioned earlier was new to the company and
among other things that we spoke about, we seemed to disagree on whether or
not it is a good idea to introduce new <em>patterns/paradigms</em> into existing
codebase. I am of the opinion that code should appear as though written by a
single author even if it has been worked on by different people. His was that
introducing newer patterns improves the quality of the code. While I agreed to
an extent with him, I would vote against this if it violates the principle of
least surprise <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>Hearing someone review some piece of code gives invaluable insight into
aspects of their personality. Like for instance their sense of ‘code smell’,
their attitude or towards performance trade-offs in a very real practical
sense, their ability (/experience) in spotting subtle bugs and just as
importantly the manner in which they express their opinions.</li>
<li>You end up treating the candidates as peers instead of making them feel
<em>uneasy</em> or <em>defensive</em> by asking questions they probably could answer when
they had just graduated.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with these in mind, I am thinking about a scenario where we could possibly
use some of our more accessible (isolated) code snapshots which have under gone
several revisions during interviews. It might be interesting to see whether we
can get the same comments as the rest of the team had made.</p>
<p>Of course, what I’m advocating is not to do away with approaches that judge
coding ability but to take a more practical/mature approach to interviewing
your peer.</p>
<p>I’m very interested in hearing whether anyone has tried this at their workplace
and what other everyday aspects of work do you suppose we can and should
incorporate into our interviewing process ?</p>

            <h1><a href="2016/05/16/auto_install_missing_python_modules.html">Auto-install missing python modules</a></h1>
<p>I just learned about a neat little python feature introduced in python 3.3 that
lets you hook into python’s default <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span></span> machinery. First a demo:</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/c7ijc2luvvqksxcn69dip0g92.js" id="asciicast-c7ijc2luvvqksxcn69dip0g92" async=""/></p>
<p>Ok, so how’s that done ? Well, there are 2 parts to it. Firstly creating the
import hook. This is exploiting the new <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">importlib</span></span> feature for registering a
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder">MetaPathFinder</a> class:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/lonetwin/b97e7b35634f7229773dece3735cfb58.js"/></p>
<p>The standard lib documentation is very detailed in explaining the <em>how</em> of this
mechanism but if you’d like to understand the why and explore other
reasons/benefits of being able to hook into the import mechanism you should take
some time to read the related PEPs.</p>
<p>The second part to this ensuring that it’s loaded into your environment. The has
been done in the demo defining the hook above in the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP">PYTHONSTARTUP</a> file.</p>
<p>If you liked this neat little trick and are interested in other such useful
hacks, do check out my <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/lonetwin/5902720">custom python startup</a>. Comments and suggestion are always
appreciated.</p>

            <h1><a href="2014/12/09/interview_cake.html">Interview Cake</a></h1>
<p>A while ago I discovered <a class="reference external" href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">Interview Cake</a> via a <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7477095">Hacker News</a> post and I’m so
glad to have found it.</p>
<p>I recommend it to anyone who feels like they are at a disadvantage as
programmers because somehow, along the way, they skipped having to learn
<em>Algorithms and Data Stuctures</em> and now the subject just seems way too
intimidating.</p>
<p>I felt that way for the longest time and I’ve always regretted not having a
<em>^formal computer science^</em> background. I have tried numerous times to
formally study <em>Algorithrms and Data Stuctures</em> from books, videos and other
online resources but I often felt handicapped as a programmer for not ever
completing the books or videos lectures ...etc</p>
<p>And although, over time I did pick up enough of comp-sci’y knowledge to reason
about code and speak intelligently about design, (or sometimes even fake
convincingly about those ;-) ), I’ve always tended to linger on the shores of
the subject, testily getting my feet wet, never diving deep.</p>
<p>This was primarily because invariably all books that I came across started off
being way too technical without a whole lot of practical or motivating pretext
for the concepts or approaching the subject with a dry academic sense of
purpose. The mental leap necessary to relate what the books taught to
<em>getting-shit-done</em> was often times too large ...and I’m (or at least would
like to think I am) a pragmatic programmer who wants to solve interesting
problems using the tools at hand.</p>
<p>So, although a formal study of the complexity of algorithms made for
interesting bedside reading, it never stuck and I’d soon get bored.</p>
<p>Until I saw <a class="reference external" href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">Interview Cake</a> that is. This site presents problems (typically
the kind that you’d face during the technical rounds of an interview for a
developer position) – but it isn’t just another <a class="reference external" href="https://codility.com/">codility</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://projecteuler.net/">project
euler</a>, there is a definite sense of purpose to the way the problems are
presented, broken down, hints offered and solutions explained.</p>
<p>It makes you <strong>want</strong> to learn the concepts if you don’t already know the
answers and most importantly it is approachable to programmers like me who
learned the art of programming by being an apprentice instead of books.</p>
<p>This site is <strong>NOT</strong> a place to learn the concepts of comp-science but it is a
great resource to wheat your appetite. I am now, stoked about ‘deep diving’
in to <em>A&amp;DS</em> and more importantly, I feel like I can remain interested. Also, I
feel confident that I’ll be a better programmer due to this.</p>

<p>Keeping things organized is not one of my strengths and this is evident by
looking at the filesystems on any of the myriad storage devices in my
possession.</p>
<p>The folders and files struggle to maintain a sense of perceivable order and
intent for being where they are and named as they have been. Beyond the lack of
structure and confusing names though, the thing that bothers me the most is the
fact that I seem to over time, collect multiple copied of these blasted
byte-collections for no good reason.</p>
<p>I’m a byte hoarder and worse still, I can’t seem to organize my hoard.</p>
<p>Although, I do try. Sometimes. Like for instance when I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lonetwin/finddup">finddup</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Now, although <cite>finddup</cite> started off as being just a tool to allow me to regain
some space (and order, in the bit-chaos) on my harddisk, it has turned out to
be a wonderful journey of discovery into the concepts of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">Locality-sensitive hashing</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex">Soundex</a> algorithms. All this because I was dissatisfied with the way I
implemented the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fuzzy</span></span> option.</p>
<p>I won’t attempt to explain these concepts here in this post, since firstly, I
am not sure I understand them well enough yet and secondly since there already
are so many good resources that explain these. However, I do hope to update the
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fuzzy</span></span> matching option of <cite>finddup</cite> to make use of LSH. That way, I can
implement it and in the process understand it as well.</p>
<p>What I do what to emphasize here tho’ is this – trying to solve simple
problems can teach you a great many new things if you challenge yourself to
find better or even different ways to solve those problems.</p>
<p>Remember that future me !</p>

<p>Although I’ve had the site <a class="reference external" href="http://lonetwin.net/">http://lonetwin.net/</a> for a while now, where I
occasionally (rarely, in fact) blog, I thought of maintaining a relatively more
active tech blog which would be different from my usual ranting and gyaan giving
at lonetwin.net. Different in the sense that, although I might just rant and
give gyaan, it would be more tech related and banal in comparison to <em>serious,
thought provoking, deeper (iow, navel gazing)</em> posts o’re there.</p>
