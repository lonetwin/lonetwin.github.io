            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Interview Cake</h1>
<p>A while ago I discovered <a class="reference external" href="https://www.interviewcake.com">Interview Cake</a> via a <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7477095">Hacker News</a> post and I’m so
glad to have found it.</p>
<p>I recommend it to anyone who feels like they are at a disadvantage as
programmers because somehow, along the way, they skipped having to learn
<em>Algorithms and Data Stuctures</em> and now the subject just seems way too
intimidating.</p>
<p>I felt that way for the longest time and I’ve always regretted not having a
<em>^formal computer science^</em> background. I have tried numerous times to
formally study <em>Algorithrms and Data Stuctures</em> from books, videos and other
online resources but I often felt handicapped as a programmer for not ever
completing the books or videos lectures ...etc</p>
<p>And although, over time I did pick up enough of comp-sci’y knowledge to reason
about code and speak intelligently about design, (or sometimes even fake
convincingly about those ;-) ), I’ve always tended to linger on the shores of
the subject, testily getting my feet wet, never diving deep.</p>
<p>This was primarily because invariably all books that I came across started off
being way too technical without a whole lot of practical or motivating pretext
for the concepts or approaching the subject with a dry academic sense of
purpose. The mental leap necessary to relate what the books taught to
<em>getting-shit-done</em> was often times too large ...and I’m (or at least would
like to think I am) a pragmatic programmer who wants to solve interesting
problems using the tools at hand.</p>
<p>So, although a formal study of the complexity of algorithms made for
interesting bedside reading, it never stuck and I’d soon get bored.</p>
<p>Until I saw <a class="reference external" href="https://www.interviewcake.com">Interview Cake</a> that is. This site presents problems (typically
the kind that you’d face during the technical rounds of an interview for a
developer position) – but it isn’t just another <a class="reference external" href="https://codility.com">codility</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://projecteuler.net">project
euler</a>, there is a definite sense of purpose to the way the problems are
presented, broken down, hints offered and solutions explained.</p>
<p>It makes you <strong>want</strong> to learn the concepts if you don’t already know the
answers and most importantly it is approachable to programmers like me who
learned the art of programming by being an apprentice instead of books.</p>
<p>This site is <strong>NOT</strong> a place to learn the concepts of comp-science but it is a
great resource to wheat your appetite. I am now, stoked about ‘deep diving’
in to <em>A&amp;DS</em> and more importantly, I feel like I can remain interested. Also, I
feel confident that I’ll be a better programmer due to this.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Learning complex things by solving simple problems</h1>
<p>Keeping things organized is not one of my strengths and this is evident by
looking at the filesystems on any of the myriad storage devices in my
possession.</p>
<p>The folders and files struggle to maintain a sense of perceivable order and
intent for being where they are and named as they have been. Beyond the lack of
structure and confusing names though, the thing that bothers me the most is the
fact that I seem to over time, collect multiple copied of these blasted
byte-collections for no good reason.</p>
<p>I’m a byte hoarder and worse still, I can’t seem to organize my hoard.</p>
<p>Although, I do try. Sometimes. Like for instance when I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lonetwin/finddup">finddup</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Now, although <cite>finddup</cite> started off as being just a tool to allow me to regain
some space (and order, in the bit-chaos) on my harddisk, it has turned out to
be a wonderful journey of discovery into the concepts of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">Locality-sensitive hashing</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex">Soundex</a> algorithms. All this because I was dissatisfied with the way I
implemented the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fuzzy</span></span> option.</p>
<p>I won’t attempt to explain these concepts here in this post, since firstly, I
am not sure I understand them well enough yet and secondly since there already
are so many good resources that explain these. However, I do hope to update the
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fuzzy</span></span> matching option of <cite>finddup</cite> to make use of LSH. That way, I can
implement it and in the process understand it as well.</p>
<p>What I do what to emphasize here tho’ is this – trying to solve simple
problems can teach you a great many new things if you challenge yourself to
find better or even different ways to solve those problems.</p>
<p>Remember that future me !</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label"/><col/></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Re-wrote actually, not sure how many times I’ve written the simple
filename matching and md5sum matching versions of this.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hello, World</h1>
<p>Although I’ve had the site <a class="reference external" href="http://lonetwin.net">http://lonetwin.net/</a> for a while now, where I
occasionally (rarely, in fact) blog, I thought of maintaining a relatively more
active tech blog which would be different from my usual ranting and gyaan giving
at lonetwin.net. Different in the sense that, although I might just rant and
give gyaan, it would be more tech related and banal in comparison to <em>serious,
thought provoking, deeper (iow, navel gazing)</em> posts o’re there.</p>
<p>Thanks to the graciousness of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladris">Vlad Riscutia</a> and various other contributors
to <a class="reference external" href="http://tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a>, I now have this !</p>
<p>Let’s see where I go with it !</p>
