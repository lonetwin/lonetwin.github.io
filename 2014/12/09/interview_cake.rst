Interview Cake
==============

A while ago I discovered `Interview Cake`_ via a `Hacker News`_ post and I'm so
glad to have found it.

I'd recommend it to anyone who feels like they are at a disadvantage as
programmers because somehow, along the way, they skipped having to learn
*Algorithms and Data Stuctures* and now the subject just seems way too
intimidating.

I felt that way for the longest time and I've always regretted not having a
*^formal computer science^* background and have tried numerous times to
formally study *Algorithrms and Data Stuctures* from books, videos and other
online resources. I often felt handicapped as a programmer for not having
learned them in a proper structured manner.

And although, over time I did pick up enough of comp-sci'y knowledge to reason
about code and speak intelligently (or sometimes even fake convincingly) about
design, I've always tended to linger on the shores of the subject, testily
getting my feet wet, never diving deep.

This was primarily because invariably all books that I came across started off
being way too technical without a whole lot of practical or motivating pretext
for the concepts or approaching the subject with a dry academic sense of
purpose. The mental leap necessary to relate what the books taught to
*getting-shit-done* was often times too large ...and I'm (or at least would
like to think I am) a pragmatic programmer who wants to solve interesting
problems using the tools at hand.

So, although a formal study of the complexity of algorithms made for
interesting bedside reading, it never stuck and I'd soon get bored.

Until I saw `Interview Cake`_ that is. This site presents problems (typically
the kind that you'd face during the technical rounds of an interview for a
developer position) -- but it isn't just another `codility`_ or `project
euler`_, there is a definite sense of purpose to the way the problems are
presented, broken down, hints offered and solutions explained.

It makes you **want** to learn the concepts if you don't already know the
answers and most importantly it is approachable to programmers like me who
learned the art of programming by being an apprentice instead of books.

This site is **NOT** a place to learn the concepts of comp-science but it is a
great resource to wheat your appetite. I am now, stoked about 'deep diving'
in to *A&DS* and more importantly, I feel like I can remain interested. Also, I
feel confident that I'll be a better programmer due to this.
