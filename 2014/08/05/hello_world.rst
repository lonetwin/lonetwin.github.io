Hello, World
============

Although I've had the site http://lonetwin.net/ for a while now, where I
occasionally (rarely, in fact) blog, I thought of maintaining a relatively more
active tech blog which would be different from my usual ranting and gyaan giving
at lonetwin.net. Different in the sense that, although I might just rant and
give gyaan, it would be more tech related and banal in comparison to *serious,
thought provoking, deeper (iow, navel gazing)* posts o're there.

Thanks to the graciousness of `Vlad Riscutia`_ and various other contributors
to `Tinkerer`_, I now have this !

Let's see where I go with it !
